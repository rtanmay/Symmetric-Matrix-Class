This repository contains:

1)A header file that contains the definitions of symmetric matrix class---> SymMat

2)testcases.cpp that contains the testcases for using the SymMat class and Eigen library

3)Output images of the testcases.cpp on the terminal

4)Makefile to compile the files using make.

5)README.md (this file) which contains information about this repository and how to compile the program


**_Compiling Instructions:_**

git clone the repository

cd into that folder
